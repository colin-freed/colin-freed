- 👋 Hi, I’m @colin-freed
- 👀 I’m interested in helping the world the best way I can.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything! Ok maybe not everything but quite a lot, starting a business sure can require a broad range of knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building applications to make it easier for people to live sustainably, participate in the circular economy, and experience the wonders of life :) I have a broad range of business experience with a focus in supply chain, logistics, and operations as well as software development/implementations primarily in functional roles but I have done a wee bit of coding myself. 
- 📫 How to reach me: colin.freed@adventureware.com is the best way right now.
